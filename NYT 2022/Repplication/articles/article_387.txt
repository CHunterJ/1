Photograph IN THE latter half of the 1980s, roughly 200 American companies withdrew from South Africa, partly in protest against its apartheid system. As businesses fled the country, South Africa's segregationist president, P.W. Botha, came under increasing economic pressure. The corporate exodus contributed to the end of apartheid and was a remarkable display of the power that companies have. When they're courageous enough to use that power for good, it can help topple repressive governments. Over the past six weeks, we've witnessed a similarly extensive response from the private sector to Russia's war in Ukraine. Hundreds of American companies have announced that they are voluntarily curtailing or halting their business in Russia, according to data compiled by our team of 24 researchers at the Yale School of Management. While it's impossible to say whether all of these companies are motivated by purely moral concerns, they've all gone above and beyond what is legally required by international sanctions. It's still too early to tell whether their moves will help force Russia to end the war. But sanctions from Ukraine's allies have already shaken Russia's economy. The country's stock market is on an IV drip, and the Kremlin has imposed strict controls to prop up the value of the ruble. Companies have a role to play in keeping the economic pressure on President Vladimir Putin. To that end, our team has placed businesses in one of five categories based on their response to the war. Consumers should know whether the companies that make their food, clothes and goods are fully committed to ending Mr. Putin's atrocities. Our goal is absolute, and some might even say extreme: Every corporation with a presence in Russia must publicly commit to a total cessation of business there. Russians who rely on the food or medicine those companies make or jobs they provide may suffer hardship. But if that's what it takes to stop Mr. Putin from killing innocent Ukrainians, that's what businesses must do. We realize that some companies already do business with many other repressive and murderous regimes around the world. But now there's a chance to draw a line with one country, over one unprovoked war of aggression, and make a difference. Above are some of the biggest brands that are leaving Russia, along with companies that are staying put and supporting Mr. Putin with their imports, exports and taxes. Hundreds of companies are forfeiting profits in order to hamper Russia's war machine. Their divestment will slow the country's growth for years to come. Even if the war ends tomorrow, business leaders will think twice before investing in a country with such a capricious leader. Yet many Western businesses refuse to quit a country whose soldiers are apparently executing Ukrainian civilians. Fortunately, Americans who are sickened by businesses' indifference to the bloodshed can make their voices heard: If the companies won't boycott Russia, boycott the companies.
