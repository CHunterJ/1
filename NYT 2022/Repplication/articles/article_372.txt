Abstract: None available.

Full text: "Whatever you do, don't write a column about quitting Twitter."
This warning came from my friend and fellow journalist Carlos Lozada when I excitedly reported my departure from the platform last month.
"It's been done," he groaned. "First of all, everyone thinks their decision is so original, but they're all leaving for the same reason: It's toxic. Besides, they all end up signing back in."
Carlos was right, of course. Journalists making a grand exit from Twitter have become as clich√©d as journalists grousing about Twitter itself. Even my employer is in on it: The Times recently reset its Twitter policy, asking employees to pull back on the platform. The impending cloud of Elon Muskiness hanging over the company is sure to set off another wave of farewells.
But I still wanted to write that column.
Yes, we know the discourse on Twitter is vile. Yes, we know that people who are delightful in real life metamorphose online into reactionary trolls and virtue-signaling vigilantes. Yes, the social media landscape is populated by basement dwellers and Russian bots. Yes, everyone is terrible on Twitter.
But I left for a different reason. I left because I was terrible on Twitter. I may not have been the only one, but Twitter Me was petty, insecure, desperate to please, angry, narcissistic and needy.
I tried not to be. Because Times newsroom journalists are not supposed to tweet political opinions, I leaned hard in the opposite direction; the more inconsequential the issue, the more likely I was to tweet about it with passion. The merits of candy corn? On it. The perils of autocorrect? Covered it religiously. If my cat did something appealing, I was seized by a manic urge to post, even though cute cats belong -- at best -- on Instagram.
While most people fought other people on Twitter, I fought myself. Let others brag and humblebrag, flex and ratio and hunt their enemies down -- I'd take myself down, thank you very much. Chuckling to myself, I drafted tweets I knew would alienate friend and follower alike, master of the counter-virtue signal, if only in draft mode. Nobody saw these tweets but me, and that was bad enough.
Yet the urge to lash out at others was almost irresistible. Oh, the searing retorts I would write, bristling with un-Timesian language, when anyone dared to tweet something hostile about something I -- or one of my colleagues -- wrote. These, too, I left amid the bilious contents of my drafts folder.
Even my "successful" tweets went wrong. Once a tweet of mine about a Langston Hughes poem went viral, and out of nowhere, John Legend retweeted me. For several days I walked around with insufferable swagger. It wasn't enough for me to let this fact exist on Twitter alone. Ego ballooning, I tried to work it into any offline conversation. "You're not even a John Legend fan," I berated myself once the high had worn off.
Most of my Twitter activity took place while walking. Because of this, my tweets tended to contain at least one glaring typo, something that shook my pedantic tendencies to the core. What could I do? I'd already tweeted (too many times) about the absence of an edit function.
I grew so self-absorbed on Twitter, there was little need to look at other people's feeds. Still, occasionally I'd read others' tweets with scorn. "What a loser," I'd find myself thinking while reading someone else's inane commentary about umbrella etiquette or a loud train talker -- before realizing, with a cold buckle of the spine, that I tweeted out the same thing nearly word for word a short time ago.
I used various forms of magical thinking, persuading myself that my own version of those bad tweets contained implied scare quotes or subtle irony that distinguished them. But my tweets were no better than anyone else's.
Because of my longtime job as editor of The New York Times Book Review, I reserved my professional posts for matters related to books and language. With books, that meant participating in the same lurid promotion expected of every author with a new book, hoping to build awareness without sacrificing dignity and self-respect.
As for language, one evening, after being told by a food service employee in response to my query about where the napkins were, "The napkins are going to be over there," I tweeted stodgily: "The special tonight IS salmon; it's not 'going to be' salmon. The table IS over there; it's not 'going to be' over there. When and how and why did restaurant service language get this way?"
I was proud of this small observation, especially after a celebrated food critic I'd never met replied with gusto. "I've been wondering this a long time," he wrote. "And since when are the oysters coming with the mushrooms? Are they going to the prom?" I went to bed that night feeling clever and important.
When I awoke the next day, Twitter was lying in wait. "Who are you to make fun of how restaurant workers speak?" Twitter snarled. "Bet you've never worked in a restaurant in your life." "Choose your words carefully when you speak about the 'servants,"' one stranger cautioned. When someone dared point out, "But she said 'service,"' the original poster retorted, "You can tell what she meant."
Is it possible that on Twitter we all become the absolute worst versions of ourselves?
"Please, John Legend, come back," I'd find myself pleading silently, thumbing out another banal observation as I tripped over the curb. But John wasn't going to engage with my defense of candy corn.
Wordle was what finally did me in. I got "rupee" on my second attempt and, heart pounding, thumbs possessed, tweeted it out. I didn't use these exact words, but the tweet essentially boiled down to "I am ruler of the universe."
What's a five-letter word for jackass?
And so I left Twitter Me behind.
Of course, my journalist friend was also right that everyone writes a farewell address to Twitter and inevitably returns. In my case, I returned right away but with one key difference: I didn't bring myself along. Instead, I set up a dark account, where I no longer post or heart or reply. One thing became clear right away: Twitter is so much better without me.
