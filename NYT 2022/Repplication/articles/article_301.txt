Full text: In late May, The New York Times revealed surprising news: President Biden's foreign policy advisers disagree about something. The dispute, over tariffs on China, was tame by Washington standards: No bureaucratic knife fights, no disparaging quotes given to newspapers on background. Still, it stood out because it was so uncommon. "Public rifts among Biden officials," The Times noted, "have been rare."
For Mr. Biden and the top members of his foreign policy staff, familiarity has bred cohesion. Secretary of State Antony Blinken began working with Mr. Biden some 20 years ago. Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, served as Mr. Biden's national security adviser when he was vice president. Mr. Biden says that during the Obama administration he spent "countless hours" with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. "These people aren't just former colleagues," Ben Rhodes, who was President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser, told me. "In many cases they're friends."
By contrast, both of the last two Democratic administrations weren't just a "team of rivals," as Mr. Obama once described his vision of his cabinet. They were often teams of strangers. Les Aspin claimed he met Bill Clinton only twice while serving as his defense secretary. James Jones, Mr. Obama's first national security adviser, had a closer relationship with the man Mr. Obama defeated, John McCain.
The trust Mr. Biden's advisers have in one another has enabled them to work together in unconventional ways. In the early stages of the Ukraine crisis, the administration repeatedly stymied Russian deception by releasing details about the Kremlin's war plans. In the past, intelligence chiefs have generally held such secrets close. But both Mr. Biden's director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, and his C.I.A. director, William Burns, worked intimately with Mr. Blinken and Mr. Sullivan during the Obama years. That familiarity most likely helped overcome the turf wars that might have otherwise stymied the Biden administration's information strategy.
But harmony has a dark side: groupthink. Mr. Obama said, "I want people who are continually pushing me out of my comfort zone." Mr. Biden does not. He has filled his administration with capable, decent men and women who have ascended together through the ranks of the foreign policy establishment and generally share its assumptions. They're the best of what Mr. Rhodes famously called "the Blob," the bipartisan, Washington-based, foreign policy elite that believes maintaining the United States' global dominance is essential to ensuring American safety and international peace.
Even when the Biden administration defied establishment opinion by withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan, it did so in service of a project the Blob prizes more: bolstering America against its great power rivals, especially China. There's no evidence that Mr. Biden's most influential advisers are questioning whether that's the right priority given the threats Americans actually face.
The Blob tends to see American foreign policy as a series of military challenges, which require military solutions. Most of Mr. Biden's top aides hail from institutions that incline them toward that point of view. Before returning to government, Mr. Blinken and Ms. Haines worked at a consulting group whose clients included defense contractors. General Austin served on the board of the weapons maker Raytheon. At least 11 senior Biden foreign policy officials -- including the National Security Council's "Asia czar," Kurt Campbell, and the person who ran the Pentagon's China task force, Ely Ratner -- are alums of the Center for a New American Security, which, according to a 2020 study, received more funding from defense contractors than any other Washington think tank.
Not surprisingly, given these backgrounds, the Biden administration has proposed a military budget higher than America's at the peak of the Vietnam War, even though, according to a February Gallup poll, only 17 percent of Democrats think military spending should go up.
The Biden administration deserves credit for speedily arming Ukraine and rallying its European allies to punish Vladimir Putin's aggression. But it is also using the war to further a broader goal: cutting an adversary down to size. General Austin has said that one of America's objectives in Ukraine is "to see Russia weakened." Mr. Blinken has set an extremely high bar for lifting anti-Russian sanctions -- Moscow's withdrawal from Ukrainian territory must be "irreversible" -- and thus made it likely that a cold war with Russia will persist even after the hot war in Ukraine ends.
Even more worrying is the Biden administration's approach to China, which sees Beijing primarily as a threat to American global supremacy and thus defines relations with the world's other superpower in largely zero-sum terms. In a May 26 speech at George Washington University outlining the administration's China strategy, Mr. Blinken said it could be "summed up in three words": The United States will "invest" domestically, "align" its policies with those of its allies and "compete" with Beijing. The word "cooperate" was notably absent.
Biden officials describe their turn away from "engagement" with China as a response to its bellicose behavior­ -- especially its fortification of islands in the South China Sea and intimidation of Taiwan. But while those actions merit concern, the primary lesson of the past several years is that the gravest threats China poses to ordinary Americans stem from its contributions to climate change and pandemics, and seriously addressing these perils requires cooperating with China more.
Despite this, Mr. Blinken didn't discuss working with China on climate or public health until 38 minutes into his speech last month. And Mr. Biden's hawkish policies have fed a cycle of hostility and escalation that makes cooperation harder. Despite a joint declaration between Washington and Beijing on climate action last November, Chinese leaders have made it clear that the Biden administration cannot insulate environmental progress from a deteriorating overall relationship.
"The U.S. side hopes that climate cooperation can be an 'oasis' in China-U.S. relations," Wang Yi, China's foreign minister, said last fall, "but if that 'oasis' is surrounded by desert, it will also become desertified sooner or later."
On pandemics too, the Biden administration's zero-sum view of its relationship with Beijing has undermined efforts to rebuild the public health partnerships that Donald Trump dismantled. "U.S. vaccine diplomacy has been aimed at competing with China over geopolitical influence," a Center for Strategic and International Studies report noted last December, "not cooperating with China in the delivery of global public goods."
A former Singaporean diplomat, Kishore Mahbubani, has compared the United States and China to "two tribes of apes that continued fighting over territory while the forest around them was burning." This is the kind of jarring talk Mr. Biden's well-mannered militarists need to hear in the sanctums of power. They need colleagues who challenge the assumptions that bind them together. Unity, which is among this administration's greatest strengths, is among its greatest weaknesses, too.
