Full text: For much of my life, I was extra careful around young children, especially young boys.
I made certain not to congratulate one of them with a pat on the back, lest run-of-the-mill tenderness be misinterpreted as something else. There was no playful tousling of hair, so there would be no wrongful stirring of suspicion.
Born in 1964, I grew up when stereotypes about gay people like me were largely negative and deeply ingrained. And perhaps the cruelest of the lies about us, reflected in recurring debates about who should and shouldn't be allowed to teach in schools, was that many gay men were child molesters. It was a facet of our perversion, a function of our deviance. To leave us alone with children was to give us an opportunity to groom them into sexual activity, so we had to be watched. We had to be stopped.
I remember that verb: groom. Its meaning was both specific and sinister.
As the decades passed, its currency seemed to fade as the prejudice it gave expression to ebbed. I stopped seeing, hearing or at least noticing it. And I pretty much forgot about it, choosing to relish progress rather than rehash the indignities of the past.
But everything old is new again, including slurs.
"Grooming," as Monica Hesse wrote recently in The Washington Post, "has lately become a buzzword in anti-gay politics." She went on to note that it "preys on every parent's worst fear -- someone harming their children -- by insinuating that all gay or gender nonconforming people see their children as prey."
Are we really back here?
Oh, yes.
The debate over a recently enacted Florida law that prohibits discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity among young schoolchildren was both an emblem and an engine of the demonization of L.G.B.T.Q. people as malevolent opportunists with children in our sights. And while its backers often referred to the legislation in terms of "parental rights," some of them also spoke of it as an "anti-grooming" measure.
On her Fox News show, Laura Ingraham asked: "When did our public schools, any schools, become what are essentially grooming centers for gender-identity radicals? As a mom, I think it's appalling, it's frightening, it's disgusting, it's despicable." Somebody, please take away her thesaurus. She's in adjectival meltdown.
Another television host, Sara Gonzales, who has a show on the conservative streaming service Blaze TV, responded to a video of Chasten Buttigieg speaking to children at an L.G.B.T.Q. summer camp by tweeting, "Pete Buttigieg's husband is a groomer."
The conservative superstar Ben Shapiro expressed his support for the Florida law by saying that he was passionate in his commitment to "protecting small children from the predations of adults who wish to talk about controversial social issues" with them. "Predations" is no accidental noun. It doesn't just roll off the tongue. It is, more likely, "the skeleton key to this entire debate," as Mark Joseph Stern wrote in Slate. "It reflects an angst that gay people who do not conceal their sexuality are attempting to brainwash and molest children."
Stern went on to provide crucial historical context:
This outlandish and bigoted notion has deep roots. You see this assumption in the infamous 1961 short film "Boys Beware," which warned schoolchildren against predatory homosexuals and was produced in part by (of course) a school district. You see it in the failed 1978 campaign to ban gay teachers from California schools. You see it in Board of Education v. National Gay Task Force, a 1985 case in which the Supreme Court struck down an Oklahoma law barring teachers from "encouraging or promoting" homosexuality. (The state cited a need to protect "student morality" and "traditional cultural values," worrying about student "imitation" of gay teachers.) You see it in many ads supporting Proposition 8, which asserted that legal same-sex marriage would force educators to indoctrinate kids. (Tagline: "It has everything to do with schools.") Now we see it in Florida, Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma.
Those last three states are considering laws like Florida's, and Stern's sweep of history is a condensed one. As my Times colleague Michelle Goldberg observed in a recent column, the anti-gay campaign that the former beauty queen Anita Bryant started in 1977 had the unambiguous title Save Our Children, and Bryant once explained its necessity by saying: "Homosexuals cannot reproduce, so they must recruit. And to freshen their ranks, they must recruit the youth of America."
The world has indeed advanced since then, at least on the L.G.B.T.Q. front. Ingraham's and Shapiro's fearmongering can't erase the 2015 Supreme Court ruling that created marriage equality throughout the United States. Gonzales's dig at one Buttigieg doesn't undermine the significance of the other's political ascent.
But I'm sobered by how much hate nonetheless remains and by how readily and unabashedly many partisans vilify gay people when they sense a tactical advantage in it. I'm scared by our resurgent popularity as scapegoats, not just here but in Poland, in Hungary, in Russia, where Vladimir Putin casts himself as a righteous warrior against Western permissiveness.
And I'm saddened, because the self-consciousness that I mentioned earlier was an awful and degrading feeling, in one sense ludicrous and in another utterly sane: I understood the world in which I was operating and was taking care to protect myself. That's what you do when you're the target of bigotry. It's why such bigotry must die for good.
For the Love of Sentences
While I hesitate to play midwife to even one more word about Will Smith's behavior at the Oscars, I do love Robin Givhan's take on it in The Washington Post, which in fact bemoans the obsession with it: "The culture has little patience for the damaged thug in a T-shirt and jeans who's lucky if his power extends the length of a neighborhood block, but it has the stamina to dissect the psychic pain of a mogul in a made-to-measure Dolce & Gabbana tuxedo." (Thanks to Paulette Lynch of Fairfield, Conn., and Monika Konrad of Shrewsbury, England, for nominating this.)
Also in The Post, her colleague David Von Drehle noted that for all President Biden's considerable virtues, "when big issues are on the line, he remains the oratorical equivalent of a kid learning to ride a bike in a room full of Ming vases." (Elliot Polebaum, Bethesda, Md., and Mauri Shuler, Seattle, among others)
The theater critic Peter Marks, appraising the costume design in the Broadway revival of "Plaza Suite," noted "a mother-of-the-bride dress so redolent of springtime it might have to be mulched." (Paul Frantz, San Francisco, and Holly Hemphill, Arlington, Va., among others)
And George Will offered this on Ginni Thomas, after news broke of her stolen-election text messages to Mark Meadows: "The shelves in her mental pantry groan beneath the weight of Trumpian hysterics about the 2020 presidential election having been stolen and the republic's certain ruination under Joe Biden." (Randy Komisarek, Tucson, Ariz., and Gabe Yankowitz, Manlius, N.Y., among others)
To stay with her for a moment, here's Brian Beutler, in his weekly Crooked Media newsletter Big Tent, arguing for more aggressive investigation into how she has potentially compromised her husband's impartiality: "Leading Democrats seem to want to make the scandal go away. To put the Ginni back in the bottle, if you will." (Andy Ayers, St. Louis)
On Substack, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar not only offers political commentary but also reviews movies, and dismissed "Don't Look Up" as the cinematic equivalent of "watching drunk friends laughing at everything they say while we just wait for them to pass out." (John Hicks, Rochester, N.Y.)
In an obituary in The Times for the actress Estelle Harris, Alex Traub noted that in playing George Costanza's mother on "Seinfeld," Harris "deployed a screech that had the urgency of a hyena in its death throes." (Jay Moskovitz, Portland, Ore., and Dan Givoly, State College, Pa.) I also loved Alex's reference to how she "hyperventilated her way into the hearts of millions of 'Seinfeld' fans," which is exactly right.
Also in The Times, Hillery Stone fashioned this lovely end for a Modern Love essay that charted her marriage and divorce in terms of all her dental work over the years, images of which she had just appraised: "When the dentist closed the digital files, they shrank into a tiny folder on the screen. It seemed natural for them to disappear. Like the photos from our married Christmases and road trips, they are records of the visible and invisible, the exposed nerves and soothing crowns, the absence and the abiding presence in a place called history." (Valerie Congdon, Waterford, Mich. )

On a Personal Note
On Facebook everybody just went to an amazing destination wedding. Look at those coastal views! And the gorgeous groomsmen!
On Instagram everybody's poreless. And svelte. And at the most awesome concert. Or with the most adorable dog. (Guilty as charged.) Who'd present any lesser pooch, any other face? It's a photo gallery that would have galled Dorothea Lange and exiled Diane Arbus.
And there has been much warranted worry about what these tidied-up edits of our turbulent existences do to our emotions and esteem, about the envy they spark, the insecurity they seed.
But they're not our only portholes into other people's lives. Over recent years, I've become a scout for -- and collector of -- a different kind of dispatch, like this paragraph in a recent profile of the actress Molly Shannon by Dave Itzkoff in The Times:
On the night of June 1, 1969, when Shannon was 4, her father, Jim, was driving the family back from an all-day party to their home in Shaker Heights, Ohio. He had been drinking, and had taken a nap earlier that afternoon. About 90 minutes into the trip, he sideswiped another car and then swerved into a steel light pole. Though Molly and her older sister, Mary, survived with injuries, their younger sister, Katie, and cousin Fran were killed in the collision; her mother died later in the hospital.
That tragedy runs counter to Shannon's preternaturally smiley demeanor and fizzy exuberance, but she revisited it in the context of her new memoir, "Hello, Molly!" You'd never guess that she was the survivor of such terrible heartache and lives with a loss of that magnitude.
I paused at Dave's account of it, just as I lingered over his article last October about the actress Selma Blair's experience with multiple sclerosis and his article two months before that about the "Saturday Night Live" standout Cecily Strong, who was unveiling a book that explores her grief over the recent death of a 30-year-old cousin of hers. He had brain cancer.
By now you've correctly deduced that Dave as a writer and I as a reader pay a questionable degree of attention to celebrities. But if you see me as a grim reaper of sob stories, you're mistaken. I'm just alert to the contrast -- too often overlooked -- between people's public swaggers and private sorrows, and these celebrity confessionals throw a spotlight on it. They're reminders that our assumptions about other people's good fortune are very often a function of ignorance; our envy and self-pity are the products of myth.
That was the focus of the adaptation of my new book, "The Beauty of Dusk," that The Times published a month and a half ago, and it's a truth buried under the lies of so much social media. But you can spot it elsewhere. You just have to look for it, and recognize what you're seeing.
I'll be talking about "The Beauty of Dusk" with Judith Kelley, the dean of Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy, at 5 p.m. on Wed., April 13, in Sanford 04 on the Duke campus. The event is open to the public.
