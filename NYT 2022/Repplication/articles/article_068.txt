Full text: WASHINGTON -- Are we ready for our new Republican overlords?
Are we ready for an empowered Marjorie Taylor Greene?
Are we ready for a pumped-up, pistol-packing Lauren Boebert?
"How many AR-15s do you think Jesus would have had?" Boebert asked a crowd at a Christian campaign event in June. I'm going with none, honestly, but her answer was, "Well, he didn't have enough to keep his government from killing him."
The Denver Post pleaded: "We beg voters in western and southern Colorado not to give Rep. Lauren Boebert their vote."
The freshman representative has recently been predicting happily that we're in the end times, "the last of the last days." If Lauren Boebert is in charge, we may want to be in the end times. I'm feeling not so Rapturous about the prospect.
And then there's the future first female president, Kari Lake, who lulls you into believing, with her mellifluous voice, statements that seem to emanate from Lucifer. She's dangerous because, like Donald Trump, she has real skills from her years in TV. And she really believes this stuff, unlike Trump and Kevin McCarthy, who are faking it.
As Cecily Strong said on "Saturday Night Live" last weekend, embodying Lake, "If the people of Arizona elect me, I'll make sure they never have to vote ever again."
Speaking of "Paradise Lost," how about Ron DeSantis? The governor of Florida, who's running for a second term, is airing an ad that suggests that he was literally anointed by God to fight Democrats. God almighty, that's some high-level endorsement.
Much to our national shame, it looks like these over-the-top and way, way, way out-of-the mainstream Republicans -- and the formerly normie and now creepy Republicans who have bent the knee to the wackos out of political expediency -- are going to be running the House, maybe the Senate and certainly some states, perhaps even some that Joe Biden won two years ago.
And it looks as if Kevin McCarthy will finally realize his goal of becoming speaker, but when he speaks, it will be Marjorie Taylor Greene, Jim Jordan and Lauren Boebert doing the spewing. It will be like the devil growling through Linda Blair in "The Exorcist" -- except it will be our heads spinning.
Welcome to a rogue's gallery of crazy: Clay Higgins, who's spouting conspiracy theories about Paul Pelosi, wants to run the House Homeland Security Committee; Paul Gosar, whose own family has begged Arizonans to eject him from Congress, will be persona grata in the new majority.
In North Carolina, Bo Hines, a Republican candidate for the House, wants community panels to decide whether rape victims are able to get abortions or not. He's building on Dr. Oz's dictum that local politicians should help make that call. Even Oprah turned on her creation, Dr. Odd.
J.D. Vance, the Yale-educated, former Silicon Valley venture capitalist and author of "Hillbilly Elegy," who called Trump "America's Hitler" in 2016, before saluting him to gain public office, could join the Senate in January. Talk about American Elegy.
Even though he wrote in his best seller that Yale Law School was his "dream school," he now trashes the very system that birthed him. Last year, he gave a speech titled "The Universities Are the Enemy": His mother-in-law is a provost at the University of California San Diego.
It's disturbing to think of Vance side by side with Herschel Walker. Walker was backed by Mitch McConnell, who countenanced an obviously troubled and flawed individual even if it meant degrading the once illustrious Senate chamber.
Overall, there are nearly 300 election deniers on the ballot, but they will be all too happy to accept the results if they win.
People voting for these crazies think they're punishing Biden, Barack Obama and the Democrats. They're really punishing themselves.
These extreme Republicans don't have a plan. Their only idea is to get in, make trouble for President Biden, drag Hunter into the dock, start a bunch of stupid investigations, shut down the government, abandon Ukraine and hold the debt limit hostage.
Democrats are partly to blame. They haven't explained how they plan to get a grip on the things people are worried about: crime and inflation. Voters weren't hearing what they needed to hear from Biden, who felt morally obligated to talk about the threat to democracy, even though that's not what people are voting on.
As it turns out, a woman's right to control her body has been overshadowed by uneasiness over safety and economic security.
To top it off, Trump is promising a return. We'll see if DeSantis really is the chosen one. In Iowa on Thursday night, Trump urged the crowd to "crush the communists" at the ballot box and said that he was "very, very, very" close to deciding to "do it again."
Trump, the modern Pandora, released the evil spirits swirling around us -- racism, antisemitism, violence, hatred, conspiracy theories, and Trump mini-mes who should be nowhere near the levers of power.
Heaven help us.
