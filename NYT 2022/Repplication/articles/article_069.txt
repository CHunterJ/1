Full text: President Biden knows the political power of the price of gasoline.
About two weeks ago, fearing what an uptick in gas prices might do to Democrats at the ballot box in the midterms, Mr. Biden announced the release of 15 million barrels from the United States' emergency petroleum stockpile in an effort to drive down prices. A gallon now costs $ 3.78 on average compared with $ 5.03 five months ago, but that is still higher than what Americans want to pay.
To show he means business, Mr. Biden went a step further this week, calling on Congress to consider a windfall profits tax on oil companies, which are reaping record gains since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a spike in oil prices. "It's time for these companies to stop war profiteering," Mr. Biden said.
As he contemplates whether these measures will be enough to save his party on Tuesday, he seems to be recalling the early days of his political career. Mr. Biden entered the Senate in 1973, at the age of 30, just as the energy crisis of the 1970s was changing life as Americans had known it. In October of that year, in response to America's support of Israel in the Yom Kippur War, OPEC's Arab members imposed an embargo on the United States, sending prices soaring by more than sevenfold.
To understand the consequences of this price hike, the young senator from Delaware hitched a ride on a 47,000-pound big rig hauling hollow-shell pipe for a 15-hour, 536-mile journey through five states. After talking to hundreds of angry truckers at a stop in Shiloh, Ohio, Mr. Biden was sympathetic. The winter storm he had just driven through was, he said, "nothing compared to the snow job truck drivers I met believe the government is handing them."
The energy situation would spell political trouble for President Richard Nixon, already deeply wounded by Watergate, as Americans blamed elected officials for their troubles. Millions of Americans were waiting in lines to fill up their tanks and feeling the pinch of higher prices on their family budgets. "What is worse than 'Watergate' and all the various charges against the president? Answer -- the gas crisis in Bergen County," a suburban New Jersey man wrote to his senator. "We the American People are tired of the lack of competent and effective leadership," the Concerned Citizens of Maryland told Mr. Nixon.
Jimmy Carter, then the governor of Georgia, accused his predecessors of "gross mismanagement" as he ran for president seeking to quell the energy crisis. But after his 1976 election, Mr. Carter wasn't so lucky: A second oil shock struck in 1979, this one triggered by unrest in Iran. Prices soared again, up more than 1,000 percent since the start of the decade. "I'll give it to you straight," Mr. Carter said in 1979. "Each one of us will have to use less oil and pay more for it."
There was a "panic at the pumps," as a New York service station representative called it at the time, leading to gas riots, violence, economic chaos and more. Long lines lasted for hours and soaring prices broke the dollar-a-gallon barrier, resulting in a sense of defeat and national decay. Americans are being "crucified on the cross of inflation," a group of Chicago truckers said. "People are freaking out," the California Energy Commission's chairman said. No one came in for more blame than Mr. Carter. "Energy affects the life of every goddamn American, and most of them are mad at us," a White House aide told Newsweek. "Energy is our Vietnam," another official said.
In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Mr. Carter -- the first Democratic president of Mr. Biden's political career -- in a landslide.
By the end of the 1970s, the price of a gallon of gasoline had become one of the most explosive issues in American political life. It still is. When presidents see gas prices tick up, they inevitably get a sick feeling in their stomachs. Rising gas prices tend to correlate with a decline in presidential approval ratings, which in turn erodes support for the incumbent party at the polls.
In times of economic instability, gas prices are the most visible and easily understandable gauge of how the nation is faring: Outsize placards on every street corner and at every rest stop are a constant reminder for many citizens that times are tough, neon signs that shine projections of pocketbook pain down to the thousandth of a decimal. You don't need to know much about macroeconomics or public policy to know that you're being squeezed.
America lives under the shadow of King Oil because our lives are organized around our cars and our cars run on gasoline.
The roots of this dependence go back to before the 1970s oil shocks, to the postwar years when America's economy boomed, thanks to cheap and plentiful gas. The country was building a massive system of interstate highways made possible by the 1956 Interstate Highway Act; developers erected single-family suburban homes that required a car trip just to pick up a pint of milk; the government failed to invest in mass transit. Gas stations competed with giveaways and free windshield washings. The drive-in movie theater and the drive-through restaurant had become icons of American culture. Cars grew and grew in size until they became living rooms on wheels. With their tail fins, luxurious interiors and powerful engines, cars were the embodiment of American freedom.
Until they weren't. "The great American ride is ending," the title character in "Rabbit Is Rich," John Updike's iconic novel of late-'70s America, thinks to himself as he surveys his car lot. Instead of singing about the open road, Johnny Cash made commercials, paid for by oil companies, about the need to "drive slow and save gas."
Appeals to conservation went unheeded. Americans refused to consume less; we resisted developing new forms of energy. As a result, the nation was running in place. Americans wanted everything to be the same.
By the time Mr. Reagan left office in 1989, there were over 30 million more cars on the road than there had been at the start of the energy crisis in 1973. And in spite of calls for energy independence, America got more and more of its oil from the Persian Gulf. It was not a surprise, then, that President George H.W. Bush, himself an oilman, launched a military operation in 1991, Operation Desert Storm, in response to Saddam Hussein's attack on Kuwait. "We cannot allow any tyrant to practice economic blackmail," he said.
President Bill Clinton's term did little to wean America off its oil addiction. During his administration, S.U.V.s, which were not subject to fuel efficiency standards, were coming to dominate the market. No wonder that in 2000, as gas prices spurted up, in advance of the election, Mr. Clinton released oil from the strategic reserve, a fail-safe created in the 1970s. His solution to higher prices was to flood the market with product rather than to stem demand, hoping to bolster the electoral prospects of Al Gore, his vice president and a passionate environmentalist.
That story has continued to play out. In 2008, congressional Republicans attempted to lay the blame for record-high prices on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, calling it the "Pelosi Premium." The strategy failed, given the collapse of the economy when George W. Bush was in the White House. But the effort reflected the political reality of prices at the pump, still the case today. The question is: How long can this last?
Mr. Biden has watched as his party's political fortunes have been driven by the ups and downs of energy prices since the early 1970s. Over those nearly 50 years he has undoubtedly discovered the tension at the heart of this: While politicians live and die in the short term, it's only long-term policies that can offer an enduring solution.
Gas prices are down now, but are they down enough to help his party next week? And will they stay down ahead of the 2024 presidential election? Those questions are most likely on the top of Mr. Biden's mind.
In 1981, when Mr. Reagan, soon after taking office, used his executive authority to get rid of the price controls on oil that had come into effect during the crisis, Mr. Biden objected. "We must continue to fight for more responsible energy economic policy," he wrote in an op-ed. By that he meant a "permanent" windfall tax on oil companies, which at the time were reaping record profits. The taxes would pay for relief from the "excessive costs" of energy.
In the 1970s, Democrats thought the oil hikes that followed war and revolution in the Middle East required an equally drastic political response: price controls, rationing and corporate profit caps. Today, with OPEC price hawks taking advantage of another war, polls suggest that Mr. Biden would see enormous political and electoral dividends by imposing temporary price and profit controls on the industry. Some economists, like the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, agree.
So, too, do many members of Congress. "We know that big oil companies are exploiting Putin's invasion of Ukraine to drive up prices at the pump for American families," Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a Democrat, recently told me. "This sort of profiteering is unacceptable and we need to put a stop to it. A windfall profits tax would help us take on corporate power and deliver relief directly to families."
Now Mr. Biden is listening to the lessons of his long career. His release from the strategic petroleum reserve comes after a similar move nearly a year ago, followed up by a failed effort to get OPEC to increase its production and the jawboning of oil companies. "You should not be using your profits to buy back stock or for dividends," the president said. "Not now. Not while a war is raging." Instead, he said, "Bring down the price you charge at the pump." Or else -- as he told the companies this week.
But just as he is trying to ease Americans' pain, he also recognizes that the permanent solution comes from weaning ourselves off fossil fuels from foreign powers, like Russia and Saudi Arabia, that see oil as a geopolitical weapon. Even a young Joe Biden understood this: In the weeks after the 1973 Arab embargo, he was one of five senators who voted against the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and instead supported funding mass transit.
What was never really on the table was using less gas and driving fewer cars. President Carter tried to solve the energy crisis, in part, with a famous prime-time speech asking the United States to change its wasteful, self-indulgent ways, as Americans were waiting in gas lines. It was a colossal failure. The installation of solar panels on the White House roof, when Mr. Carter promised that 20 percent of all energy would come from the sun and other renewable sources by 2000, also fell flat.
Mr. Biden knows this. That's why he has worked hard to make renewable alternatives a reality with the Inflation Reduction Act, a climate bill investing historic amounts into a green transition. And as much as he, like so many presidents, champions himself as a "car guy" who loves his 1967 Corvette Stingray, he has also celebrated recent pushes like Ford's to phase out combustion engines.
But those changes take time. Just as they have since the 1970s, voters want relief and they want it now. In 1973, Mr. Biden said his constituents felt that "the federal government isn't listening." Nearly half a century later, as Americans take to the polls, Mr. Biden wants them to know "who is standing with them and who is only looking out for their own bottom line."
Even as Mr. Biden might get minimal short-term benefits from his energy and climate policies -- and minimal relief in gas prices in the near future -- history may look back on his record as a turning point, when America didn't just start ending its gas addiction but went further into alternatives that began making our country and our politics less in thrall to King Oil.
