Full text: If the homelessness crisis in California can offer any lessons to the rest of the country, it's what politics looks like when a restless and beleaguered public places pressure on politicians to do something -- anything -- about a complex and seemingly intractable problem. The state has spent billions of dollars a year and tried a variety of solutions; none has put much of a dent in the public face of homelessness -- the tent encampments of unhoused people that have sprung up throughout every major city in the state.
In an earlier newsletter, I outlined what I think is the emerging ideological battle line in the homelessness crisis, not only in California, but also throughout the country. There are housing-first advocates who believe that a greater supply of subsidized, supportive and affordable housing is necessary to end homelessness not only for the people on the streets but, perhaps more important, also for the people who are about to be short on a rent payment and will soon be living in their cars, in motels or in shelters. The other side, which I'll call "mental health and addiction first," believe that a liberal and permissive culture around homelessness in California's cities has opened the floodgates for mentally ill and drug addicted people from around the country to set up camp in San Francisco and Los Angeles.
Until now, the housing-first people have largely won the significant battles in both the federal government and the state of California, which both adopted their policies in the mid-2010s. But there are signs that some of this might be changing, in large part because of people's frustrations with the lack of visible change.
Last week, the California State Assembly passed a bill proposing the creation of the Community Assistance, Recovery and Empowerment Court program, or CARE Court, with a 9-to-1 vote. In the State Senate, the vote was 38 to 0 in favor. The bill, which must still make it through a few more political hurdles to become law, establishes a "framework to deliver mental health and substance use disorder services to the most severely impaired Californians who too often languish -- suffering in homelessness or incarceration -- without the treatment they desperately need."
What this means on a practical level is that if a police officer, behavioral health provider or family member observes someone acting erratically and suspects the person is suffering from a mental health breakdown, the observer can submit a petition for referral to a CARE Court, even if that person has not committed a crime. The person will then receive a "clinical evaluation" to diagnose "schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders." If any is found, the person will be appointed counsel and be entered into a CARE plan, receiving treatment in the form of counseling and court-ordered "stabilization" medications. State Senator Tom Umberg, an author of the bill, told me that it is aimed at somewhere around "7,000 to 12,000 individuals in California" with "schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like conditions" who he says are "very difficult to reach, very difficult to stabilize and very difficult to bring back into society."
Over the course of roughly a year, people in a CARE program would have to pass a variety of assessments to make sure they are keeping up with it. If they do so in a satisfactory manner, they will "graduate" from CARE Court. In drafts of the bill, there is some talk of a plan that would also help put them into temporary or permanent supportive housing, but none of the versions I've reviewed give any specifics on what that might look like or, more important, offer any firm commitments on providing that housing. When I asked Umberg, he said that CARE Court participants could get some priority in housing, but it's not clear that it would be guaranteed.
If participants dropped out of CARE Court or failed to comply with their therapy and medication program, they could ultimately be placed into a conservatorship. This means the state might be able to make every meaningful decision in their lives, from where they live to what they do with their money, and who they're allowed to see. In a conversation I had with Susan Mizner, the director of the A.C.L.U.'s Disability Rights Program, about the type of conservatorships that the CARE Court would use, she said: "There is a reason this is called the greatest deprivation of civil liberties aside from the death penalty. People in prison at least get to have visitors and decide whether they take medication."
Despite the CARE Court bill's popularity among politicians, there has been considerable pushback against it from legal, human rights and disability rights groups. In a joint letter from more than 40 organizations, advocates for homeless people called the bill a "system of coerced, court-ordered treatment that strips people with mental health disabilities of their right to make their own decisions about their lives" and pointed out that the bill wouldn't even guarantee housing for its graduates. "It's not voluntary," Eve Garrow of the A.C.L.U. told me. "The governor's administration is shrouding or cloaking this in language that makes it seem empowering and voluntary, but in reality, you're hauled into court."
Human Rights Watch called the entire process "convoluted" and pointed out the "highly subjective" criteria that could get someone entered into the CARE Court system.
Both criticisms have a point: The CARE Court bill can wrap itself in the language of help and empathy, but at its core, it is a way to force people who have not committed any crime, nor have proved themselves to be an imminent threat to the public, to be coerced into a court proceeding that will place many of them on powerful medications under the threat of a conservatorship that would take away many of their freedoms. When people entered the system, they would be assigned legal aid (earlier drafts of the bill provided a public defender). You don't assign people legal aid because they're about to enter a fully voluntary system. You assign them legal aid because they are about to enter a form of the court system. Considering that the standard for being entered into CARE Court would be the exhibition of symptoms of what Umberg called "schizophrenia-like" conditions, the subjectivity of those assessments and the potential for abuse are both certainly there.
If California cannot handle the current number of mentally ill homeless people, what will it do when the 7,000 to 12,000 more that Umberg predicted hit the system? Umberg, for his part, acknowledges that finding those workers, whether psychiatrists or social workers, will be one of the biggest challenges facing the CARE Court system. He says the governor is investing in training new workers, but given the current shortage of civic workers, especially when it comes to homeless services, it's difficult to imagine there would be anything close to enough trained professionals to fill the role. The state's continuing conundrum is that everyone wants to do something about the homeless so long as the person carrying out that work is someone else.
The other major challenge Umberg noted was around the CARE Court's housing plan for people in the system. Much of the criticism over the bill, especially from the A.C.L.U., comes from the fact that there would be no real guarantee that a CARE Court graduate would receive any form of housing. This is certainly puzzling, given that part of the state's justification in setting up CARE Courts is rightfully noting that the stress of living on the streets contributes to mental illness and makes it more difficult for people to seek or maintain treatment. If the state cannot guarantee a homeless, mentally ill person a place to stay, how can it really compel that person to seek regular treatments or check in with a counselor and the court, especially when the state agrees that homelessness, itself, is a main driver of the symptoms of mental illness?
This is the question that CARE Courts put in front of Californians: How much are you willing to play fast and loose with the civil liberties of chronically homeless, mentally ill people? It's true that homelessness is the state's most pressing problem and that most residents, including me, are dismayed on a daily basis at the seeming intractability of the problem.
The billions of dollars the state spends per year on homelessness solutions includes significant investments in housing. But while housing-first policies can provide relief for many people who are about to lose their homes or fall in and out of homelessness, they are not a panacea that will keep chronically unhoused, mentally ill people off the streets. (To be fair, no serious housing-first advocates would ever say that their approach could solve every problem.) This is why the political mood in the state has swung so quickly toward a type of desperation that says something -- anything -- must be done.
Such bluster and silly promises actually have made it nearly impossible to tell which proposals should be taken seriously and which ones should not, which ones are simply the reflexive ideations of politicians under strain and which ones try to solve a problem. Or if there even is really a difference anymore between the two.
One can sympathize with the frustration of the supporters of the CARE Court without falling into the type of talk that says a group of people -- in the case the homeless -- constitute an emergency and that something must be done about them. The norms of civil liberties in this country should dictate that the state should not be able to use vague criteria like "schizophrenia-like" conditions to compel people to take medication and enter a court system under the threat of a conservatorship that would take away nearly all of their freedoms, even in cases where they have not committed a crime or posed a threat to the public.
Consumables
Over the weekend, the family and friends of the historian Mike Davis announced that he had decided to stop treatment for cancer and was on palliative care. No scholar or writer has had a clearer understanding of California.
Davis has been a hero of mine ever since I read his essay "The Case for Letting Malibu Burn" in college. There are so many moments in my life when I see California through his work -- when I walk past an inhospitable and fortresslike building in Los Angeles, which I now know has been designed to deter the poor from congregating outside; when I see a dense patch of brush that I know will one day catch fire; or when I see the low-slung stretches of single-family homes in the San Fernando Valley. He saw the state as a place of corruption, inequality and runaway capitalist greed, but he also saw its immense beauty, the possibilities of solidarity between all its peoples and the dignity of people who were doing their best to survive. The best writers burrow themselves in the back of your eyeballs and color everything you see. Davis is that for me -- my California is the California he excavated through his reporting, his scholarship, his activism and his unflappable moral integrity.
Here is just a small sampling of his work:
"The Case for Letting Malibu Burn," republished at Longreads.
"Fortress L.A.," which appears in his landmark book "City of Quartz," published by Verso Books.
And three other books from Verso: "Set the Night on Fire: L.A. in the 60s," with Jon Wiener; "Planet of Slums"; and "The Monster Enters: Covid-19, Avian Flu, and the Plagues of Capitalism."
