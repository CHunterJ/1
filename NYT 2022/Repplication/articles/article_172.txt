Full text: What is school really for? Students at Oakland's Fremont High answer this question with their cameras.
OAKLAND, Calif. -- School is a community, a common place to gain relationships. School is for social interactions and learning to become an active member of society.
Most grown-ups believe that school is only for learning back-to-back. They don't understand the parts that build character for us teens. They don't understand that school is where we grow and learn to express ourselves. The things we go through are like the practice tests for what comes next.
These photos show the community and social parts of our school, Fremont High; they show the common struggle and the growth that you can get only from a high school. The photos were taken over the course of one busy week in August by students in Fremont's media academy. Each photo has a caption written by the student photographer. We also have quotes from Fremont students sharing their view on what school means to them. -- Kendal Erving, 15, sophomore
Student photographers: Fabiola Chavez Ayala, 14, junior; Jahmese Jones Dunbar, 15, junior; Michael, 14, sophomore; Yizel Ceja Martinez, 14, sophomore; Edwin Pineda, 15, sophomore; Santiago, 17, senior; and Amanakilelei (Naki) Tuakoi, 16, junior.
The Media Academy at Fremont High School is a training ground for students considering careers in media.
Faculty advisers: Kevin Kunishi teaches photography and multimedia in Fremont's media program. His personal work as a photographer focuses on long-form documentary projects. Jasmene Miranda is a career technical education teacher and program director at Fremont, of which she is a proud graduate.

Photograph [1] Some upperclassmen chillin' out in the bleachers watching everything play out. -- Jahmese Jones Dunbar, 15, junior; [2] Second period digital art, taught by Mr. Basta, has to be one of my favorite classes. -- Fabiola Chavez Ayala, 14, junior; [3] During the passing period, everyone comes together just to talk and have some type of fun before we have to go back to our 50-minute class periods. -- Jahmese Jones Dunbar; [4] Ms. Zap, an English teacher, takes attendance. -- Jahmese Jones Dunbar; [5] Goofing off during Spanish class, the last class of the day, a.k.a. the most relaxing period of the day. -- Jahmese Jones Dunbar; [6] Fremont High School sometimes feels small, with around 1,000 students. But it's during the passing period that I get my daily reminder of how big the school really is. Passing period makes the school feel lively. You see groups of friends talking to one another or teachers greeting their students. -- Fabiola Chavez Ayala; [7] Lunch from the school cafeteria: a chicken burrito and some fruit. The burrito actually tasted pretty good. -- Michael, 14, sophomore; [8] Jimmie and I like to joke around with each other. Recently I saw him do a pose from a famous anime called "JoJo's Bizarre Adventure." The pose is known to be made by someone named Dio, so we call it the Dio pose. I dared him to do it, and to my surprise, he did it almost perfectly. -- Fabiola Chavez Ayala; [9] Vanessa is getting ready to enter her A.P. world history class and then wonders, "What is the point of having lockers if we can't use them?" -- Yizel Ceja Martinez, 14, sophomore; [10] Angel enjoys a well-earned break after football practice. -- Amanakilelei (Naki) Tuakoi, 16, junior; [11] Football players prepare to get in formation during practice. -- Edwin Pineda, 15, sophomore (SR6-SR7)
