Full text: AFTER SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, there are many common refrains -- thoughts and prayers, calls to ban weapons, and, in recent years, to arm teachers. But at least 29 states already permit people like teachers to carry guns in schools. Requirements, exceptions and trainings vary.
Mike Smith saw firsthand in 2015 how the issue of armed teachers plays out in the real world, when, as the chief of police in Pleasant Grove, Utah, he responded to a report of an armed person at the high school his children attended. It turned out to be a false alarm, but the sweep of the school found that two teachers were keeping unsecured firearms in their classrooms.
"The reality is that we know teachers are carrying guns in schools," the law enforcement officer told Lulu Garcia-Navarro, host of The Times's "First Person" podcast. "And for there to be no policies in place, no procedures in place, no training in place, is not good at all." He became sheriff in Utah County in 2018 and then started the Teachers Academy to teach educators how to safely use firearms. The program includes hands-on instruction, tactical trauma education, school shooter simulations and de-escalation training. Below is a condensed and edited version of Sheriff Smith and Ms.Garcia-Navarro's conversation.
First Person is available at NYTimes.com and through major podcast platforms. The next episode, available Thursday, follows a teacher attending Sheriff Smith's academy.
Lulu Garcia-Navarro: What's the general mood like on the first day of, let's say, your current class?
Mike Smith: I think most of them are actually excited to be there. A lot of them have been on a waiting list for a while to get into this. They feel like, in a way, they've been let down by their schools because they haven't been provided this type of training. And they want it.
Garcia-Navarro: Do you approach the training as getting teachers to think more like law enforcement?
Smith: No, we're not trying to get them to think like law enforcement. We're not asking them to do our jobs. I do not want teachers chasing a gunman through a school.
We talk about, you bring a gun into a school, you are liable for whatever happens with that weapon. And if that's something that you can't deal with, then you need to reconsider having a weapon in school. If you're going to carry a gun into a school environment, and all you've done is went and bought a gun at a gun store, and now you're carrying it, and that's your level of proficiency -- and I've seen that happen -- it's not a good situation.
Garcia-Navarro: How many of the people who come to these classes are already carrying in their own schools?
Smith: I never ask them that. So I know some are, right, because some will offer that out. But I never ask them. And at the end, I don't ask them if they're going to carry. I've had teachers come and tell me, at the end of the day, that they have been carrying a gun. And now, after going through our school, they're no longer going to carry a gun. There are teachers who maybe had made up their minds that, hey, I'm going to get a gun and I'm going to carry it in school, and they come through our class, and now we've given them enough information that they're processing it, and they're going, you know: 'I'm not sure. I want to keep my school safe.' So we're helping them to develop a plan.
Garcia-Navarro: Do you think that having someone being armed at an incident makes law enforcement's job harder?
Smith: It could. But citizens have responded to these very types of incidents,these active killing incidents, and they have made a difference.
Garcia-Navarro: So, clearly, this is a very complicated issue with a lot of challenges. And as you discovered, when you found the unsecured guns in teachers' desks, not every gun owner is a responsible gun owner. I am wondering if you think maybe there just needs to be a regulation of who can have a gun in the first place, which would solve the problem that's causing some teachers to feel like they need to carry in school.
Smith: Well, I don't think you're reeling back where this nation is in availability of weapons. It's easy to say we're going to regulate something. The guns have always been here. These problems have not always been here. What has happened to bring a society to a point where kids are killing kids? And it's not the gun. It's the easy coward solution to say it's an object. It's not an object. It's a people problem.
Garcia-Navarro: What I'm hearing you say is that you don't think that the vast availability of weapons in the United States is actually the problem, but rather, it's a societal issue about how they're used. Smith: I think it is.
Garcia-Navarro: There is a debate that is ongoing in this country about how many guns we have. And many people think that it's, frankly, crazy that we're in a situation where you have to be trying to help teachers figure out if they should carry a weapon in their kindergarten class. What do you think about those ideas that perhaps this has all gone too far?
Smith: I guess I don't get what question you're actually asking me, but yeah, it's gone too far. But it's just how you look at it, I guess.
Garcia-Navarro: Hmm. You're pouring a ton of time into trying to make something safer that could be viewed as sort of reckless in principle. And there are many groups who oppose the idea of introducing firearms into schools. By holding trainings, do you think that you're implicitly sort of endorsing the idea that carrying a firearm in a school can be done safely?
Smith: We are dealing with the reality that we're facing that no one else is addressing. We get the bad rap that, why are you arming teachers? Well, we are not arming teachers. We are aware that some teachers are arming themselves. And we are trying to provide a level of training for them and give them some things to think about. They don't come out of our academy as experts in anything. What they come out of our academy with is the reality of their level of performance. And the criticism is going to come. I get it -- it has. At the end of the day, I guess I ask the question back, what are you doing? Teachers and kids are dying all over this country. I don't control the gun laws. You don't control them. What are you doing? We're doing what is in our wheelhouse, what we have the ability to do. And that is to address a problem that we're seeing that is being neglected.
Garcia-Navarro: Personally, training aside, what do you believe about whether or not teachers should be armed?
Smith: I believe that teachers are in a very bad position. If this problem continues and we keep seeing these horrific events happening, I guess the question is, do teachers have a right to defend themselves and their students? This is a situation they should never have to be in. No one should ever have to be in it.
Garcia-Navarro: But here we are.
Smith: But here we are.
