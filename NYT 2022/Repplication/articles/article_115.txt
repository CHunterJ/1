Full text: One big reason for the chronic housing shortage in America's most prosperous regions is that state governments have ceded control to local governments that behave like private clubs.
In California, the heartland of the housing crisis, the state is starting to take power back.
The state's political leaders are clearing the way for housing construction by restricting local interference, prioritizing the needs of all Californians -- and those who might like to be.
Every year for the last half-dozen years, the California Legislature has passed a set of bills that shift the balance of power toward building. Among the latest batch, signed into law over the last few weeks by Gov. Gavin Newsom, are bills easing the conversion of commercial buildings into homes and banning parking requirements for housing and retail developments near public transit.
Perhaps even more important, Mr. Newsom's administration is working to enforce the laws, as the Times reporters Conor Dougherty and Soumya Karlamangla detailed in a recent article.
One example of the state's enforcement efforts: A landmark measure passed in 2021 allows at least two homes on most residential lots, but cities quickly fought back by imposing absurd requirements on those seeking to build new housing. Among the crazier ones cataloged by The Times: "A covered porch, the signature of an archaeologist, the highest level of energy efficiency and an automatic garage door."
Woodside, a wealthy town in Silicon Valley, barred duplex construction by declaring the entire community a protected habitat for mountain lions. The state's attorney general, Rob Bonta, responded with a warning. "My message to Woodside is simple: Act in good faith, follow the law, and do your part to increase the housing supply," Mr. Bonta said. "If you don't, my office won't stand idly by." Woodside soon announced it was ready to issue permits for duplex construction.
One of the earliest pro-housing measures that California passed, in 2016, sought to make it easier to add a garage or basement apartment to a single-family home. Local governments tried to undermine that law by allowing applications to pile up, imposing exorbitant fees and writing clever restrictions.
So the state passed more laws to clear those impediments, and to create a stronger legal basis for lawsuits against obstructionist municipalities. In 2015, local governments issued 1,205 permits for the construction of accessory units in California. In 2020, the most recent year for which comprehensive data is available, 12,569 permits were issued, according to an analysis by the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. And the state has since passed a law seeking to make it even easier to build such units.
California has a long way to go. Mr. Newsom was elected in 2018 on a platform of full-throated support for more housing, declaring that the state needed a "Marshall Plan for affordable housing." He set a goal of 3.5 million new housing units by 2025, consistent with expert estimates of the state's need. Meeting that goal would require 500,000 new housing units annually, but last year, in 2021, local governments issued permits for only about 120,000 units.
Mr. Newsom's unrealistic rhetoric should not overshadow the state's progress. It takes time to build, and these changes are laying the groundwork for much more housing in years to come.
This is a sea change in California politics, after many decades in which the state tolerated local resistance to construction, and it reflects the intensity of the crisis. To take one indicative measure, for every 100 lower-income families that rent housing in California, there are about 60 units of affordable housing available, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. In New York -- a state that is in the throes of a serious housing crisis by any metric except "Are We Doing Better Than California?" -- the comparable figure is still 84 units. (That is, in part, because housing remains more affordable outside of the New York City area, and because New Jersey eases pressure in the metro area by allowing construction along the west bank of the Hudson.)
The crisis also is starkly visible in California, where tens of thousands of people who cannot afford stable housing live in doorways, in their vehicles or in tents pitched on open land.
And the rise of the tech sector has helped to reshape the politics of housing. Some of the new billionaires may not care how the other half lives, but others, believers in technocratic solutions to social problems, have embraced the proposition that the solution to a housing crisis is more housing. They have pumped money into research, lobbying and lawsuits, constructing a professional class of advocates.
California YIMBY, founded in 2017, got much of its early funding from the tech industry, including $ 1 million from the online payment company Stripe. "The dearth of available and affordable housing is a significant barrier to the Bay Area's economic progress," the company's chief executive, Patrick Collison, said at the time. "We think broad policy change will make the most meaningful, widespread and long-term difference in the state's housing crisis, by allowing developers to build more housing -- specifically lower-cost, higher-density housing."
Cities have deep pockets to resist the state laws; this tech-sector money means that proponents now have deep pockets, too.
One of the most important tools in California's arsenal is a law requiring local governments to make room for enough housing to meet projected demand. The law lacked teeth until it was modified in 2017.
Shortly after Mr. Newsom took office in January 2019, his administration became the first to take action under the strengthened law, suing the Orange County city of Huntington Beach. The city had created a plan in 2015 that included room for 413 units of affordable housing. Then, in response to local opposition, it reduced that number to just 70. The lawsuit forced another rewrite.
Huntington Beach settled the case by agreeing to allow the construction of more than 500 units of low-income housing. In an interview last month, Mr. Newsom said the lawsuit was meant as an early demonstration of his "fanatical intention" to increase the supply of housing in California. "It's a question of political will," he said.
The state has created a Housing Accountability Unit to pursue similar cases. The budget is only about $ 4 million a year, but Jason Elliott, a senior adviser to Mr. Newsom on housing issues, said that by holding local governments accountable, the unit could facilitate more construction than the billions of dollars the state spends annually on building subsidies. In August, the unit announced an investigation of San Francisco, where it takes an average of 975 days to obtain a construction permit -- when one can be obtained at all.
Mr. Newsom's will for battle is not boundless. Shortly after taking office in 2019, he proposed withholding state transportation funds from communities that failed to meet housing goals. It is a sensible idea, echoing President Biden's proposal during the 2020 campaign to condition some federal infrastructure funding on changes in local zoning to allow more construction. But Mr. Biden has not followed through, and a political backlash convinced Mr. Newsom to drop his version, too.
But the willingness of California's state leaders to override the obstructionist proclivities of local governments in the service of the broader public interest is making a real difference. Similar courage is needed from political leaders in New York and other states where it has become unreasonably difficult to build housing in the places where people want to live.
