Full text: Republicans are outraged -- or possibly simply pretending to be outraged -- that President Biden has, in recent speeches, warned that "MAGA Republicans" are a threat to democracy and, at one point, called the philosophy fueling Trumpism "semi-fascism."
But there is no scandal here. Biden was simply calling a thing a thing. In fact, I would prefer that he be even more pointed and not try so hard to dodge the charge that he's casting the net too widely.
Biden first used the term "semi-fascism" two weeks ago, at a Democratic fund-raiser in Maryland, saying: "It's not just Trump; it's the entire philosophy that underpins the -- I'm going to say, something, it's like semi-fascism."
Republicans quickly demanded that he apologize for insulting half the electorate. But those Republicans who voted for Donald Trump deserve to be called out for their actions. Trump has consistently exhibited fascist tendencies, as well as espoused racism, misogyny and white nationalism. Republicans supported him, defended him and voted for him. They've been actively courting this condemnation.
And yet, ever since the initial brouhaha over his fascism comments, Biden has insisted on walking back his assertion, seemingly determined to distinguish more genteel Republicans from the rest of their party. At a rally in Maryland, shortly after his fund-raiser, Biden said: "I respect conservative Republicans. I don't respect these MAGA Republicans."
Personally, I have a very hard time splitting that hair. In 2020, 92 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning independent voters backed Trump. According to a Quinnipiac University poll released last week, 73 percent of Republicans still have a favorable opinion of him, and 72 percent want him to run for re-election in 2024.
The overwhelming majority of Republicans support Trump. The pool of respectable conservatives is shallow, and that's assuming that they can be neatly defined as those not voting for Trump.
Still, it is clear that Biden is sensitive to the criticism, even as he charges ahead with this pointed assessment.
In Biden's speech in Philadelphia on Thursday, he returned to the idea that "MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic." But he took pains to more clearly separate them from other Republicans, saying that "not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology."
Still, he underscored that "there is no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans."
Biden was twisting himself into a rhetorical knot when there was no reason to do so. When he said that not even a majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans, it muddied the waters. What, to Joe Biden, is a MAGA Republican?
On Friday, Biden walked his comments back further still, telling reporters, "I don't consider any Trump supporter to be a threat to the country."
He went on to say, "I do think anyone who calls for the use of violence, fails to condemn violence when it's used, refuses to acknowledge an election has been won, insists upon changing the way in which we rule and count votes -- that is a threat to democracy."
Make no mistake: A significant portion of Republican voters have done exactly what Biden has tried to exempt them from having done. A Public Religion Research Institute poll published in November found that nearly a third of Republicans agreed with the statement "Because things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country."
Also, a later poll found that a quarter of Republicans were adherents of the internet conspiracy theory QAnon and believe that "there is a storm coming soon that will sweep away the elites in power and restore the rightful leaders" and that "a group of Satan-worshiping pedophiles who run a global child sex-trafficking operation" control America's government, media and financial system.
As PolitiFact noted in June, citing a number of polls, roughly 70 percent of Republicans don't see Biden as the legitimate winner of the presidency.
Furthermore, a July accounting by FiveThirtyEight found that "halfway through the primary season, we can say definitively that at least 120 election deniers have won their party's nomination and will be on the ballot in the fall." Republican voters delivered primary victories to those candidates.
Republicans have a knack for persuading Democrats to pull their punches. It was the same strategy they used against Barack Obama after he said some Americans were "bitter" and "cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations."
He was absolutely correct, but in politics, telling the truth can be a sin.
It was the same strategy Republicans used against Hillary Clinton after she said: "You could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic -- you name it. And unfortunately there are people like that. And he has lifted them up."
She was absolutely right. She may have even understated the number.
Democrats have to stop falling for the line that calling out the dangers that some voters present to the country is somehow a divisive, offensive, unfair attack on the innocent. No person who voted for Trump or supports him now is above being named and shamed.
Biden doesn't owe Republicans an apology; they owe the country an apology.
