Full text: Let's talk about the culture war we should be fighting. When we think of what's important to the "religious right" or to "white evangelicals," the focus tends to be on social issues: abortion, the role of religion in public life, conflicts around sexual orientation and gender identity, and lately, controversy over critical race theory.
Social issues determine which corporations conservative Christians deem moral or immoral, good or bad. There have been calls to boycott Disney for its seemingly pro-L.G.B.T. stance. Disney also angered conservatives by pledging to help employees travel to other states to obtain abortions. On the other hand, Hobby Lobby is viewed as a "Christian" company because of its stance on contraception, its "Jesus Saves, Bro" coffee mugs and its commitment to print "full-page ads celebrating the real meaning of Christmas, Easter and Independence Day." One Christian legal nonprofit puts corporations on a "nice" or "naughty" list each year based on their use of the term "Christmas" versus the more general "holiday" celebration. There was even a minor dust-up in a niche corner of Christian Twitter about "Whole Foods Christians" versus "Cracker Barrel Christians." This is the stuff that the culture wars feed on. It's the fodder for trending hashtags, outrage and denunciations.
But the people who debate the morality (or lack thereof) of Disney or Hobby Lobby rarely discuss how much paid time off these companies provide employees or whether they pay a living wage or what the wealth disparity is between their top and bottom earners or whether they have adequate maternity leave policies or how much a corporation financially gives back to a community.
Meanwhile, economic disparity continues to widen. In 2020, Pew reported that the middle class has been shrinking since the early 1970s. Since the 1980s the biggest spike in income has occurred for the top 5 percent of earners in America. The report concludes that over the past five decades -- the whole course of our lives for many of us -- there's been a "long and steady rise in income inequality." Still, despite the popularity of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 Democratic primary, a Pew report from the same year said that while a majority of Americans think there is "too much economic inequality" in the nation, fewer than half view this as a top political priority. The report also said that Republicans are likely to blame individuals rather than systemic forces for economic inequality, citing lifestyle choices or that "some people work harder than others."
But how would our contemporary understanding of politics change if economic justice is in fact a "traditional value"? The indifference Christians on the right often show about wealth disparity flies in the face of thousands of years of Christian teachings. While Christians throughout church history cared deeply about sexual and personal morality, the linchpin of a Christian vision of the social order was the flourishing of the economically disadvantaged. When church leaders across the ages cited evidence of social disorder, they consistently pointed to vast economic inequality.
It's not news that Christianity, like many other religions, values care for the poor. Throw a dart at the Bible and you are likely to hit a verse about the need to aid the vulnerable, to care for orphans and widows, to love the "least of these." And most conservative Christians today would affirm the value of individual charity. But what strikes me as I listen to voices across history is not just that Christian leaders called for charity toward the poor but that they also emphasized economic justice. The poor were not simply those masses that we must patronizingly remember in our Christmas giving; they were entitled to material well-being. The rich were denounced as being in grave spiritual danger. Beyond that, the church proclaimed that society -- including the government -- had a responsibility to rein in greed and to ensure just distribution of wealth.
Basil the Great, one of the most influential theologians in the Christian tradition and a fourth-century bishop, argued that the rich who refused to share their goods with the poor were thieves and robbers: "The person who strips another of clothing is called a thief. And those who might clothe the naked and do not -- should they not be given the same name? The bread in your board belongs to the hungry; the cloak in your wardrobe belongs to the naked." He thunders, "the money in your vaults belongs to the destitute." The rich, he said, are "murderers of the poor."
He condemned deriving "profit from miseries" and gaining "money from tears" through the exploitation of workers. Basil took from the scriptures that God had made the whole earth communal property. It was greed, he said, that created a division into private property, and greed that had caused those who are sophisticated or cunning to hoard their wealth. This kind of thinking is not unique to Basil.
John Chrysostom, archbishop of Constantinople in the fourth century who was famous for his preaching, delivered scathing sermons about those who embraced privilege and luxury when others remained poor. He castigated government leaders for their opulence and neglect of the poor.
One finds similar-sounding language in Christian leaders through history -- Lactantius, Augustine and Martin Luther. The healing of the social order, according to these leaders, required the wealthy to change their motivations in light of Christ, to use their wealth not for private interests but for public welfare. One after another, a chorus of voices condemned usury -- the lending of money at interest -- except in very narrow circumstances. It makes one at least have to question what Augustine or Basil would say about student loan reform, credit card interest rates or calls to increase the minimum wage.
We may look at these statements from church history as mere idealism, the products of a naïve era in which the dynamics and benefits of capitalism were yet undiscovered. But we find similar ideas repeated in the modern age.
Reformation-era figures like the English bishop John Hooper railed against the rich of his diocese as "raveners and eaters of the poor" and pronounced that "these men, except they repent, cannot be saved." Hooper certainly believed in the necessity of private charity, but not to the exclusion of systemic economic change. In a letter to the secretary of state under King Edward VI, Hooper asked for "redress" that the wealth of "every shire" not be "taken into a few men's hands" and that the rich not be permitted to buy "when things be good cheap, to sell afterwards dear." He was asking for what we would now call economic regulation.
Jonathan Edwards, famous for his terrifying sermon "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" (and, thanks to Lin-Manuel Miranda, for being Aaron Burr's grandfather), issued hellfire and brimstone warnings to the winners in capitalism -- those who would "buy as cheap and sell as dear as they can"-- as much as to those committing sexual immorality. Those denouncing "greedflation" find a surprising ally in this puritan preacher. A recent biographer of Edwards said that he believed "calamitous price fluctuations" could be traced to "a greedy spirit" in those who would "advance their private interests on the great loss and damage of the public society." Edwards went so far as to preach after widespread crop failure that because his community did not redistribute its wealth to meet the needs of the poor, God, as a judgment on the rich, redistributed poverty through famine.
The 19th-century Anglican bishop Brooke Foss Westcott likewise insisted that Christianity deals "not only with personal character" but "also with the State, with classes, with social conditions." He asked his priests to monitor labor conditions in their parish districts, to seek economic justice. Christian leaders continued to advocate economic reforms into the 20th century, but the fundamentalist-modernist controversy divided Protestant churches in America. Evangelicals, fundamentalists and others with more theologically conservative religious beliefs increasingly grew silent on economic justice. There are important exceptions to this. Catholic social teaching -- and leaders like Dorothy Day -- championed the labor movement. Black church traditions also held together convictions that white conservatives and progressives pried apart. Even among white Western evangelicals, voices like John Stott, Ron Sider and Jim Wallis called on their movement to address economic disparity.
Likewise, the global church, which grew exponentially in the 20th century, continued to agitate for economic justice. David Gitari, the archbishop of the Anglican Church of Kenya from 1997 to 2002, identified as an evangelical and was conservative on social matters. But he criticized American evangelicals for their tendency "to concentrate more on spiritual matters and to ignore the sociopolitical issues that also affect the whole individual." Still, because of divisions among white Christians, advocating for economic justice and addressing income inequality is often seen as the preserve of a small subculture of religious progressivism instead of what it is: a chief concern of traditional Christian orthodoxy that is echoed throughout time.
Many Christian voices from the past preceded widespread democracy, of course. Their context was different, but we who are Christians shouldn't easily shrug away such a consistent witness of the Christian tradition. It's not that these leaders didn't care about today's "culture war" issues -- they certainly had what would now be considered traditional or conservative mores when it comes to sex, gender and abortion. But this through line of church teaching about economic justice highlights how the marriage of social and religious conservatism with pro-capitalist, libertarian economics is a bizarre modern invention.
If we don't talk about economic justice, if we aren't passionate about curbing extreme wealth inequality, we are proffering an emaciated view of Christian political engagement, one shaped more by contemporary American discourse than the long history of the church.
