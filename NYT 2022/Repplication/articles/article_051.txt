Full text: For over a year I've been seeing headlines lamenting the return of Y2K-era fashion, along with its focus on extreme thinness and jean rises so low, to paraphrase "Absolutely Fabulous," the world's your gynecologist.
To wit: "Recall any red carpet image from the 1990s to the late aughts, when jeans were at their lowest and crop tops were really more like bralettes, items for which a flat stomach has often been an unspoken requirement," Rebecca Jennings wrote for Vox in April 2021. More recently, The New York Post, subtle as a sledgehammer, announced, "Bye-bye booty: Heroin chic is back," noting "waifish" frames on runways in Paris and Milan and Kim Kardashian losing weight to fit into Marilyn Monroe's dress.
Both The Post and Vox suggest that the pressure to be thin has diminished somewhat since the aughts. They cite a handful of celebrities with different body types in pop culture and a rising body positivity movement. In the same breath, The Post mentioned body positivity with the newish "slim thick" ideal, almost implying it was somehow more attainable, even though it still involves a tiny waist and a flat stomach, because it includes curves as well.
But it's clear to me -- and to anyone who's been studying teen and tween girls over the past few decades -- that the super-thin ideal never really went away, no matter the rise of the jeans the Hadid sisters happen to be wearing. And the insidious nature of that ideal has been pretty constant since the '90s, or has possibly become worse: A review of studies published from 2000 to 2018 found that the prevalence of eating disorders "increased over the study period from 3.5 percent for the 2000-06 period to 7.8 percent for the 2013-18 period."
The impact of the thin ideal starts young. According to a 2016 study, over 50 percent of girls between the ages of 9 and 14 "wanted a thinner shape." These kinds of findings go back decades: A 1991 study found that 42 percent of preadolescent girls desired "thinner figures" and "expectations regarding thinness among females may be evident as early as 6 and 7 years of age." (Boys experience body dissatisfaction, too, but it tends to be more common when they're underweight.)
"The thin ideal has gone nowhere," said Virginia Sole-Smith, who has written for The Times about eating and parenting and is the author of the forthcoming "Fat Talk: Parenting in the Age of Diet Culture." Though she says there have been small steps toward mainstream awareness of anti-fat bias because of online discourse about it and the presence of highly admired fat women in popular culture, "it's not like we canceled Kate Moss." Sole-Smith added that high fashion has never really been size diverse, referencing a 2018 interview with Miuccia Prada -- the designer and fashion scion after whom the label Miu Miu is named -- where she said: "Size diversity, again, in theory I accept, but so far I didn't have really the courage to do it." Teenage girls in particular, Sole-Smith said, are "still under pressure to fit into this norm, and they're exquisitely aware of how they don't measure up."
I spoke to Jennifer Mills, a professor of psychology at York University in Toronto who has studied the thin ideal and the newer iterations of "slim thick" and "fit" (toned and athletic but still slender). Despite these new versions rising in popularity, the putatively ideal body is still "very rare in the real world, and it would be extremely difficult to attain," she said. Mills said that in her clinical practice she sees patients who are using and abusing laxatives and diuretics, and she is particularly concerned about the rise of waist trainers, which have been described as modern-day corsets.
Though there's been a rise in eating disorder diagnoses since social media came on the scene, the relationship between teenage girls' social media use and body image is complicated. Jasmine Fardouly, a social psychologist and researcher at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, told me last year that image-based platforms like Instagram and TikTok have a "small link to negative body image." However, as I wrote then:
Even the research that finds spending time on social media is associated with greater instances of disordered eating behavior and negative feelings about body image is careful to note, causality cannot be determined: In other words, these studies cannot tease out whether girls who are inclined toward eating issues, for a variety of reasons, spend more time on social media, or whether the social media causes the issues.
Mills's research has found that mind-set matters when looking at social media. She and her colleagues designed an experiment where a set of women completed a "self-compassion" writing task before and after looking at social media. The experiment instructed these women to write a paragraph to themselves "expressing kindness, compassion and understanding toward yourself regarding your weight, appearance and body shape." Mills's study found that doing the self-compassion task before looking at thin-ideal images from a curated Instagram feed helped women maintain their baseline body image. If they did the self-compassion task after looking at the feed, "it didn't help. It wasn't enough to override the increases in dissatisfaction" from seeing the thin ideal images, Mills told me.
Sole-Smith emphasized that what happens at your kitchen table may matter more than what is happening on social media or coming down the runway. If you are uncomfortable with different body types and emphasize a particular aesthetic in a normative way, your kids will pick up on that, she said. You won't be able to change the culture outside your home, but you can "trust they're going to come back to these core values you're giving them." Having activities and peer groups where runway-model skinniness isn't necessarily the focus can also help, she said.
Having lived through the early aughts, I can't say I'm excited to see the fashion of that vintage return. Give me Angela Chase and her Doc Martens over Paris Hilton and her Juicy Couture tracksuits any day. I can't control what's in vogue as my daughters grow up, but at home, I will deliver a message to try to counteract the tyranny of an unhealthy "ideal" almost no one can achieve without airbrushing.

In 2020, Virginia Sole-Smith wrote a piece for The Times called "Your Kids Don't Have to Inherit Your Body-Image Issues," which has advice for helping your kids develop a positive relationship with food even if it's something you struggle with.
Earlier this year, a reader asked The Times's chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman: Can I still wear low-rise jeans as I get older?
In 2017, The Times's Maya Salam wrote about why "radical body love" was thriving on Instagram.
Tiny Victories
Parenting can be a grind. Let's celebrate the tiny victories.
My 2-year-old daughter does not like to wash her hands after using the bathroom. She dressed up as the witch from "Room on the Broom" for Halloween and for the past month has been putting spells on people by saying: "Abracadabra ... pew! You're a rabbit/frog/ogre." The other night, she resisted washing her hands and I could feel my frustration mounting. I stopped myself, flicked water over her head like a priest with holy water and said: "Abracadabra ... pew! You will listen to Mama!" She laughed and then finished washing her hands.
